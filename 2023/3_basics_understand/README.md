# Strong Understanding of Basics

To achieve this goal, I will allocate ___2 hours per week___ to revise the following topics and create workflows that will ensure that I respect those standards and take full advantage of every technology.

### Design

As a frontend developer and designer, I need to have a solid understanding of what makes a good website. Web3.0 aims to be inclusive, therefore accessibility is also an important consideration.

1. UI / UX
   - Responsive on 3 levels - Mobile, Tablet, Desktop
   - Page speed
   - Attractive Calls to Action
   - Hyperlink differentiation
   - Consistency (spacings, font sizes, colors, etc.)
   - Ghost Loading (Suspence loading)
2. Accessibility
   - Colorblind palettes
   - Use of colors and patterns to convey information
   - Keyboard accessibility

### Code

As I move towards using more complex framework and implementing more advanced features, understanding the basics and core principles is critical. Therefore, even if I am fairly comfortable with the basics, I shall revisit them with my current experience to deepen my understanding and refresh my memory. Here's what I would like to go over;
