# Managers Can Track my Work

Use the appropriate task tracking tools so that my managers can easily track my work and understand all that I am working on. That will also allow me to review what I was able to build this year. Here's how I will do it;

1. Create a backlog of tasks I see coming in the future sprint
2. Before starting to work, make sure an issue exists for it
3. When an issue changes status, update it in the task management software
4. Issues are complete and help traceability
   - Issues are assigned to me
   - Issues are in the right project
   - Issues are linked to the relevant commits, pull-requests or images are linked to show design progress
