# 2023 Milestone

My goal for 2023 is to become a senior frontend developer by the end of the year. To reach that milestone, here are my goals.

---

## [1. Work is Completed on Time](/2023/1_work_on_time/)

The ability of delivering on time is highly valued. Here's how I will improve my assiduity;

1. Understand and respect project scope
2. No personal tasks or gaming during work hours (8 to 4)
3. Plan sprints in advance and make sure completion is almost certain while remaining ambitious
4. Follow Good Practices & Standards
   - Mobile First
   - TDD
   - and more...

## [2. Managers Can Track my Work](/2023/2_track_work/)

Use the appropriate task tracking tools so that my managers can easily track my work and understand all that I am working on. That will also allow me to review what I was able to build this year. Here's how I will do it;

1. Create a backlog of tasks I see coming in the future sprint
2. Before starting to work, make sure an issue exists for it
3. When an issue changes status, update it in the task management software
4. Issues are complete and help traceability
   - Issues are assigned to me
   - Issues are in the right project
   - Issues are linked to the relevant commits, pull-requests or images are linked to show design progress

## [3. Strong Understanding of the Basics](/2023/3_basics_understanding/)

To achieve this goal, I will allocate ___2 hours per week___ to revise the following topics and create workflows that will ensure that I respect those standards and take full advantage of every technology.

### Design

As a frontend developer and designer, I need to have a solid understanding of what makes a good website. Web3.0 aims to be inclusive, therefore accessibility is also an important consideration.

1. UI / UX
   - Responsive on 3 levels - Mobile, Tablet, Desktop
   - Page speed
   - Attractive Calls to Action
   - Hyperlink differentiation
   - Consistency (spacings, font sizes, colors, etc.)
   - Ghost Loading (Suspence loading)
2. Accessibility
   - Colorblind palettes
   - Use of colors and patterns to convey information
   - Keyboard accessibility

### Code

As I move towards using more complex framework and implementing more advanced features, understanding the basics and core principles is critical. Therefore, even if I am fairly comfortable with the basics, I shall revisit them with my current experience to deepen my understanding and refresh my memory. Here's what I would like to go over;

1. HTML
   - Accessibility
   - Forms & Validation
   - SEO basics
   - Making Layouts
   - Writing Semantic HTML
2. Accessibility
3. CSS
4. JavaScript and its versions (ES15, ES17, etc.)
   - Objects, etc.
   - Asynchronous execution
   - Hoisting, Event Bubbling, Scope Prototype, Shadow DOM, strict
5. DOM
6. Advanced Debugging
7. Web Security
   - OWASP
8. Build Tools
9. Linters
10. Module bundlers (compilers)
11. Testing
   - Unit, Integration, Functional
12. Agile methodology
   - SCRUM
   - Kanban

## [5. Abilities Have Grown](/2023/5_new_abilities/)

To make sure that my skills are still relevant, I need to make sure to take time to learn the latest technologies and version of frameworks I am using. Therefore, I will allocate __2 hours per week__ to reading documentation, looking at videos, etc. on the latest web development standards.
